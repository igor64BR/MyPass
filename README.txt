Thank you for attention.
My PASS is a educational project developed by me and it's pretty functional.

When the application is running, a window will pop-up showing some fills in blank, except for the email fill.

The email autofill is settled to 'example@gmail.com' but it can be changed to your main email or to be in blank when you
run the project. In the main file you'll fin the rules to adapt the instructions to change it.

When you insert the website or software name, email and password or generate it, you can save the data in a 'data.txt'
file. But, if you prefer, it's possible to change the file name and/or it's location:
    To change the name, just change the file name in the main file.
    To change the file location, add the absolute file location (E.g.: 'C:/Users/YourUser/Program Files/MyPass/data.txt')

After setting, is just run and enjoy. Remember: If you don't have any idea of a new password, use the Generate button to
create a full randomized one, from 8 to 16 characters, always containing a normal letter, capital letter, symbols and
numbers.

Enjoy!
